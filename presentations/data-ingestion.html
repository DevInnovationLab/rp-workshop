            ## What is the first thing you do when you receive new data?

            <div class="fragment fade-in">
              <ul>
                <li>Decide where to store it</li>
                <li>Save a protected copy</li>
                <li>Open the data</li>

            ## Where to store data
            - According to UChicago guidelines, data should be stored in Box
            - Box has a *lock* feature, that prevents files from being modified or deleted
            - This feature should be used for any data that you cannot recreate
            - Keep this original data in locked storage in the same file format and with the same content as you received
            - You can save any necessary changes as new files

            <p class="highlight fragment fade-in">
              Ideally, decisions on folder structure and data storage plaftorms have already been made and documented ahead of time.
              <div class="highlight fragment fade-in">
                If that was not the case, take a moment to really think about it before you place data data somewhere you'll never find it again
              </div>
            </p>
           
            ---
            
            ## Where to store data

            - Large data sets may need special storage
            - We will talk more about options for big data when discussing cluster access

            ---

            ## Importing data

            - We often receive data in formats that are not easy to open in statistical software
            - The first thing you'll want to do if that applies to your data is to save it in a format that is appropriate for your software
              - `.rds` for R
              - `.dta` for Stata
            - This will allow you to open the data faster and to preserve variable formats such as dates, factors and labels
            - If your data contains dates or text, be mindful of how this information is encoded

            ---

            ## Useful tools to save data

            - In R: 
              - `save` + `load`
              - `write_rds` + `read_rds` (from `readr`)
            - In Stata:
              - `save` + `use`
              - `compress`
              - `saveold`
              - `iesave` (from `ietoolkit`)

            ---

            ## Working with sensitive data

            - If you received sensitive data, but it is not strictly necessary for analysis, save sensitive data fields separately from non-sensitive ones
            - Sensitive data requires specific workflows that may take more time to implement
            - Make sure you have a way to reconnect sensitive and non-sensistive fields if needed

            ---

            ## What is the first thing you look for when you open new data set?

            - Unit(s) of observation
            - Variables included
            - Type of information included

            <p class="highlight fragment fade-in">
              Please share data documentation with data files!
            </p>

            Note:
            Raise your hand if you ever received data with cryptic variable names and struggled to find out what they meant
