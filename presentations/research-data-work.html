            ## Setup

            - Grab your name tent
            - Grab a red and a green post-it
            - Form groups of 4-5 people who use the same software as you do
              - Create a fork of https://github.com/DevInnovationLab/rp-workshop for your group
              - Add all group members to your fork
              - Choose one of the papers listed in the README to use for some of the exercises

              ## Research data work: tasks

              - Collecting primary data
              - Validating data quality
              - Running simulations
              - Preparing data for analysis
              - Presenting descriptive statistics
              - Presenting analysis results

              Note:
              - Processing:
                - Turn the raw data into data that you can actually use to create your final data set. Objective/research question agnostic
                - Data processing is the most time-consuming stage of research, and you will be tempted to skip steps
                - Taking time to prepare your data will save you more over the course of the project. It will also save you some embarassment
                - Getting your hands dirty on the data will also make you very knowlegeadble about it. This can be a very significant contribution to the project
              - Analysis:
                - Adapting clean data to our research needs
                - transforming the data
                - project-specific

            ## Planning data work

            Note:
            - Why?
            - "Here's some data. Show me the results of this model"
            - "These are all the data we have, here's where we want to get, here's the steps to get there"

            ## Research design

            - What is the research question?
            - What is the method used?
            - What are the main outcomes?
            - What are the main controls?

            ---
            
            ## Data needs

            - What data do we need to analyze?
            - How can we measure these indicators?
            - What are the units of observations?
            - What are the data sources?
            - How does this information relate to one another?
            - How do we get from the raw data to the analysis data?
            
            ---

            ## Data map

            - Documents the plan for data work
            - Creates a shared understanding of what steps need to happen before analysis can begin
            
            ---

            ## Data map: components

            - [**Data linkage table:**](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data_Linkage_Table) a list of all the raw data tables in the project, their level of observation, and how they can be linked to other data tables
            - [**Data flow chart:**](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data_Flow_Charts) a plan for how to create each analysis data table from the raw data
            
            ---

            ## The nitty gritty
            - What software is best suited for the project?
            - How to organize folders?
            - Naming conventions
            - Style guides
            - Write everything down!
