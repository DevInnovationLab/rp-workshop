                        ## Data validation

                        - Input: a clean and tidy data set
                        - Objectives:
                          1. Ensuring that the data quality is as high as it can be
                          1. Documenting patterns that may bias our analysis
                        - Output:
                          - A data set that is very similar do the initial one, but may contain some corrections
                          - Documentation about any data quality issues found in the data
                        
                        ---
                        
                        ## No data is safe from quality issues

                        Note: 
                        - raise your hand if you ever found something in your data that simply did not make sense
                        - raise your hand if you are in the habit of testing the quality of the data before analyzing it
                        - raise your hand if your data processing code automatically flags issues in the data

                        ## Exploring new data

                        What is the first thing you look at when working with a new data set?

                              <li>What column in the data <b>identifies</b> a unit in this data table?</li>  
                            </ol>
                        </div>

                        ## Completeness
                        
                        - Missing values are common source of issues when handling data
                        - When inspecting new data, check that the data is complete
                          - Across time
                          - Across space or groups
                          - Across units of observation
                       
                        Note:
                        - Skip patterns should normally be predictable. For example, you're only asked how many hours a week you work if you are employed
                        - Do all the observations in one region show missing values for a particular variable? 
                        - Is a particular enumerator skipping entire survey sections?
                        - Was some information only collected after a certain date?

                        ## Consistency

                        Values in a data set should be consistent
                        1. For any given variable across observations
                        1. Across variables for any given observation
                        1. For related information across data tables
                        1. With pre-existing information and common sense 

                        <p class="highlight fragment fade-in">
                            This is the most subjective issue in the list, and requires knowledge of the data and of the subject matter
                        </p>

                        Note:
                        Ask for examples for each case:
                        1. Yes/No and Y/N used for the same variable
                        1. Pregnant males
                        1. Mother says she has no children on mother data table, but is listed as a mother in the children table
                        1. Being 150 years-old is not reasonable, if we know there are only 10 states in a country, we should not have data for 8 different states

                        ## Extreme values
                        
                        - Identifying outliers can help us find incorrect values in our data
                        - However, extreme values are not always mistakes
                        - Still, even correctly measured outliers can affect our analysis
                        - For example, by leading to results that are driven by only a few units in our sample
                        
                        <p class="highlight fragment fade-in">

                              <li class="fragment fade-in">You should check how sensitive your results are to data quality issues. This can be done by simulating noise or by testing what happens when you disregard observations with suspicious values.</li>

                        - Is the data set uniquely and fully identified?

                        - Are there any inconsistencies in the data?
