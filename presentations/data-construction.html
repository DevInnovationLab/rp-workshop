                        ## Joining (merging) data tables

                        - In R: `join`
                        - In Stata: `merge`

                        <p class="highlight fragment fade-in"><b>What can go wrong?</b></p>
                        <p class="highlight fragment fade-in">How can we test that this is not happening?</p>                    

                        Note:
                        - adding/removing observations
                        - predict number of matches/mismatches
                        - count number of observations before and after
                        - check that they match the prediction

                        ---

                        ## Binding (appending) data tables

                        - In R: `bind_rows`
                        - In Stata: `append`

                        <div class="fragment fade-in">
                            <p class="highlight"><b>What can go wrong?</b></p>
                            <p class="highlight ">How can we test that this is not happening?</p>  
                        </div> 

                        Note:
                        - variable names don't match
                        - differently coded values (categories)
                        - different units of measurement

                        ---

                        ## Aggregating values by groups

                        - In R: `group_by` + `summarise`
                        - In Stata: `collapse`

                        <div class="fragment fade-in">
                            <p class="highlight"><b>What can go wrong?</b></p>
                            <p class="highlight ">How can we test that this is not happening?</p>  
                        </div>  

                        Note:
                        - missing values
                        - `na.rm`
                        - how collapse treats different operations differently

                        ---

                        ## Aggregating values across observations

                        - In R: `group_by` + `summarise`
                        - In Stata: `collapse`

                        <div class="fragment fade-in">
                            <p class="highlight"><b>What can go wrong?</b></p>
                            <p class="highlight ">How can we test that this is not happening?</p>  
                        </div> 

                        Note:
                        - missing values

                        ---

                        ## Aggregating values within observations

                        - In R: `rowwise` + `mutate`
                        - In Stata: `egen`

                        <div class="fragment fade-in">
                            <p class="highlight"><b>What can go wrong?</b></p>
                            <p class="highlight ">How can we test that this is not happening?</p>  
                        </div> 

                        Note:
                        - missing values
                        - in R: rowwise is slow
                        - Stata: + vs rowtotal

                        ---

                        ## Building checks into your code

                        - In R: `assert_that`
                        - In Stata: `assert`

                        ## Some opinionated advice

                        - Data construction should be the only point in your workflow where you are changing the *values* in the data (as opposed to the format of the data)
                        - Create new variables instead of replacing the ones that were originally observed (so you can compare them)
                        - Constructed variables should have intuitive and functional names
                        - The order of variables in your constructed data set can make it easier or harder to find information in it
                        - Keep a lot of documentation on the research decisions involved in data construction
                          - Why did we choose to use one definition and not another?
                          - When was this decision taken and by whom?

                        ---

                        ## Some opinionated advice

                        - Literate programming tools like [quarto](https://quarto.org/), [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [markstat](https://grodri.github.io/markstat/) are very useful throughout data processing and analysis
                        - They can be used to quickly compile documents with graphs and tables
                        - But they can also be used to document data processing by writing actual text with your code instead of only writing occasional comments
                        - You can find a short example [here](https://raw.githack.com/luizaandrade/r-example/main/assignment.html)

                        ## Exercise

                        1. Choose at least one of the dangerous steps we talked about -- one that you do, have done or will do a lot.
                        1. Look at the help files for the functions or commands discussed to program these steps.
                        1. Write code to implement them.
                        1. Write code to check that none of the possible issues we mentioned have occurred.
