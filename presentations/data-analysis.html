            ## Story time

            Note:
            - My PI likes to use overleaf, and before every meeting I need to upload all the new analysis results to the website and recompile the document
            - My PI asked me to run some complicated regressions. I spent a lot of time and energy getting the code to run. When it finally did, 
            I outputted it into a table and shared it with my PI, who immediately noticed the number of observations was varying a lot from one column to the other
            - My PI decided to change the set of control variables for all analysis in a project and it took me a long time to find all the different lines in all the different scripts where I listed the controls
            - My results changed every time I ran a regression
            - My PI asked me to do some initial analysis. I created a table and exported it to Excel. They asked me to do some very specific formating on Excel and I did it, 
            but then they decided to make a lot of changes to the analysis and for every change I had to spend a lot of time formatting the table again only for them to decide they wanted try to something else

            ## When it comes to *coding*, analysis is the easy part

            ---

            ## A good analysis script

            <ol>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Starts with a fresh workspace</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Loads the data created during construction</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Runs a regression, calculates summary statistics code or creates a graph</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Displays or exports results</li>
            </ol>

            Note:
            - it starts with a fresh workspace so it does not depend on having run anything in particular before
            - note that there is no data processing going on
            
            ---

            ## A good analysis script

            - Makes research decisions clear
            - Has simple code that allows the reader to focus on the model
            - Makes it easy to understand which results are coming from each part of the code
            - Is easy to maintain even if research decisions change

            ---

            ## Applying good coding practices to analysis code

            ---

            ## Maintainability

            <div class="highlight">
              <b>The DRY rule:</b>
              "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"
            </div>

            ---

            ## Modularity

            <div class="highlight">
              <b>Modular programming</b> is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.
            </div>

            ---

            ## Don't reinvent the wheel

            <ul>
              <li>There are plenty of existing packages for statistical analysis and presentation of results</li>
              <li>Canned functions often go through some sort of review</li>
              <li>They are also usually programmed to handle errors and edge cases</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Don't try to write code from scratch unless there is no other way to implement your analysis</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">If you are not 100% confident about a package, test it and compare results with those of another software</li>
            </ul>

            ---

            ## More opinionated advice

            - Define research inputs such as outcomes and controls in one place, and retrieve these inputs when needed
            - Use functions to simplify and standardize aspects of the code that are not related to the research, such as graphics themes and table formatting
            - Use file names and document outlines to connect code to specific results

            ## Unstable results

            <ul>
              <li>The most common source of unstable results are random processes</li>
              <ul>
                <li class="fragment fade-in">Remember to set a seed if they are present in your code</li>
                <li class="fragment fade-in">Software version can also make a different here</li>
              </ul>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">In Stata, the order of observations may also matter -- and it should not!</li>
            </ul>

            ---

            ## Unstable results

            - An easy way to find out if your results are unstable is to track changes to them
            - Export tables to TeX or csv and track them using git
            - GitHub can also track changes to images
            - Rerun analysis after making changes to the data even if the analysis scripts didn't change and check if your results are changing

            ---

            ## Using categorical variables correctly

            - Stata does not automatically recognize labeled variables as categorical variables
            - To control for different categories of a variable, use factors in R and the `i.` operator in Stata
            - Avoid creating a series of dummies to represent each individual category
            - If you are not interested in the coefficients of fixed effects, use commands that don't report them automatically

            ---

            ## Using interactions correctly

            <ul>
              <li>Both R and Stata have built-in interaction operations</li>
              <li>Using built-in operations instead of manually multiplying variables is one example of how not to reinvent the wheel</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">What is the difference between `#` and `##` in Stata?</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">In R, apart from the base `*` operator, `fixest` offers additional interaction functionality </li>
            </ul> 

            Note:
            - why not manually calculate interaction variables?

            ## Start simple

            <ul>
              <li>It's helpful to start writing analysis code with the most simple version of a model, even if you don't plan to report these results</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Run a linear model before trying something more complex</li>
                <li>Add only a few covariates at a time</li>
                <li>IDf working with large data sets, use only a subsample at first</li>
                <li>You can even work with simulated data if you don't have the real data yet</li>
              </ul>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Use this opportunity to test your code and methods</li>
              <ul class="fragment fade-in">
                <li>Make the code more efficient</li>
                <li>Think about the best practices discussed before</li>
                <li>Make sure you understand your modelling choices</li>
              </ul>
            </ul> 
            
            ---

            ## Start simple

            - For initial and exploratory results, you want to be able to update outputs quickly
            - These outputs will typically only be used by people in the research team who are familiar with the project
            - Markdown documents are a great solution for this, with the added advantage of being able to see the code
            - Don't stress too much about the perfect formatting for every single table and figure
            - Iterate on this format of document until you know what results you want to present

            ---

            ## But be mindful of details

            - When your code runs, you are only half done!
            - Spend some time interpreting results and understanding them before sharing them with PIs
            - Think critically about the numbers you see: 
              - Do they make sense to you?
              - What additional questions can you anticipate based on the results?

            ---

            ## Polishing final outputs

            - You want to minimize the number of times you will make precise adjustments to the aesthetics of outputs
            - But at least one team member needs to learn the nitty gritty of formatting tables and creating graphs
            - Agree on a style before you start formatting tables and figures
            - Have in mind who is the audience of the outputs while doing so
            - Remeber that tables and figures should be self-standing: labels and detailed notes are important

            ---

            ## Writing code for final outputs

            - Automate the creation of outputs and final documents as much as possible
            - Stay away from workflows that rely on copy-pasting
            - Use accessible formats to save output (png, svg, tex, csv)
            - In Stata: `outreg2`, `esttab`, `graph export`
            - In R: `stargazer`, `huxtable`, `kable`, `modelsummary`, `ggsave`

            ## Exercise

            - If you haven't yet, choose a reproducibility package from the list to work on
            - Try to find out which part of the script creates which exhibit without looking at the read me file
            - Take a closer look at the analysis code and see if you can come up with suggestions on how to improve it

            ---

            ## Exercise

            - Choose one of the visualizations in the paper and see how well it does according to [this checklist](https://stephanieevergreen.com/rate-your-visualization/)
            - Choose one of the tables in the paper and see how many of the items in [this checklist](https://devinnovationlab.github.io/guides/templates/paper-submission.html#review-results-and-summary-statistics-tables) it satisfies
